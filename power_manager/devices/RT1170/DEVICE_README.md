# Power Manager Enablement for RT1170

The power manager for RT1170 is an essential component that integrates many features of RT1170's power architecture. It manages the power states of a system and provides a wide range of options to optimize power consumption. According to NXP's official datasheet, the power manager provides up to 17 typical system power states, each with its own unique set of features and capabilities.

The RT1170 PM covers the following features:

1. On/Off clock sources, including 29 oscillators or PLLs.
2. Power on/off power domains, including CM7 domain, CM4 domain, MEGA domain, DISPLAY domain, WAKEUP domain, and LPSR domain.
3. Enable/disable power supplies, including DCDC and LDOs.
4. Enable/disable system STANDBY request.
5. Enable/disable bandgap and body biasing.
6. Control wakeup generator (optional).

Based on the features listed above, it is clear that the power manager controls the ON/OFF status of the system's basic resources (clock source, power domain, power supply). Please note that clock roots, clock gates and clock groups are not controlled by the power manager; it is the application's responsibility to manage them.

## Resource Constraints

It is important to note that the operation modes of basic resources can vary depending on the power state. For example, in low power states, certain resources may be disabled or put into sleep mode to conserve energy. The table below outlines the differences in operation modes between different power states. By carefully selecting the appropriate operation mode for basic resources, you can ensure optimal energy efficiency.

Three of the resources in question are optional in different power states: the CM7 domain's operation mode, the CM4 domain's operation mode, and standby request.

The CPU domain can operate in different modes based on application settings:

- RUN: The CPU core is active and running under normal operation. All blocks inside the CPU platform can be accessed when needed.
- WAIT: The CPU is in the WFI/WFE state, but can return to RUN mode with very short latency. In typical applications, the CPU enters WAIT mode whenever there is no active thread running. In WAIT mode, the clock to the CPU core is gated off, the cache is clock gated, and the TCM is still active since there are other modules, such as DMA, that still need access to it.
- STOP: The CPU is in the WFI/WFE state, but can return to RUN mode with very short latency. In typical applications, the CPU enters STOP mode whenever there is no active thread running. In STOP mode, the clock to the CPU core is gated off, the cache is clock gated, and the TCM is still active since there are other modules, such as DMA, that still need access to it.
- SUSPEND: Entering SUSPEND mode results in the lowest power consumption, and exit time is not critical. In SUSPEND mode, the CPU, cache, and peripherals are all power gated. The biggest difference between SUSPEND and STOP mode is that the peripherals are power gated. Because the peripherals are power gated, entering SUSPEND mode requires the CPU to save the state of the peripherals. When exiting from SUSPEND mode, the CPU needs to restore these states.

Users can also choose to request standby or not in different low power states. Standby mode is a low-power mode that has distinct settings outside of CPU mode and setpoint mode. After asserting standby request, **BANDGAP**, **M7_FBB**, **SOC_RBB**, **LPSR_RBB**, **PLL_LDO**, **LPSR_ANA_LDO**, and **LPSR_DIG_LDO** will enter standby mode. By default, the STANDBY request is asserted. Users can de-assert standby request by setting corresponding resource constraints.

Based on the table above, NXP provides macros that allow users to transfer the basic resources' operating mode to the power manager.

## Power State Constraints

The RT1170 provides 17 different power states, each allowing for varying levels of power consumption. Users can set the lowest power state that the application is allowed to use by creating a power state constraint. This constraint ensures that the application is operating at the most energy-efficient level possible, ultimately helping to extend the device's battery life.

```c
PM_LP_STATE_SP0
PM_LP_STATE_SP1
PM_LP_STATE_SP2
PM_LP_STATE_SP3
PM_LP_STATE_SP4
PM_LP_STATE_SP5

PM_LP_STATE_SP12
PM_LP_STATE_SP13
PM_LP_STATE_SP14
PM_LP_STATE_SP15
PM_LP_STATE_SNVS
```

## Wakeup Source ID

The power manager framework also allows you to configure the RT1170's wakeup generator (in the GPC module). This covers all wakeup sources except for **debug_wakeup** and the **wakeup event**.

It is important to note that the power manager framework only enables interrupts in the NVIC and unmasks related interrupts in the GPC. It is the responsibility of the application to set and enable peripheral interrupts.

## Optional Settings

Users can disable certain features of the power manager by changing the macros in fsl_pm_device_config.h.

```c
#define FSL_PM_SUPPORT_NOTIFICATION          (true)
#define FSL_PM_SUPPORT_WAKEUP_SOURCE_MANAGER (true)
#define FSL_PM_SUPPORT_LP_TIMER_CONTROLLER   (true)
```

## Suggested Uses

As previously mentioned, the power manager framework is responsible only for turning system basic resources ON/OFF. If an application requires the core domain to remain active at a different setpoint, it is the responsibility of the application to set the clock root's mux and clock frequency at that setpoint. Note that some clock sources are disabled in specific setpoints.

For different setpoints, NXP has provided recommended settings:

| Resource settings | Setpoint0 | Setpoint1 | Setpoint2 | Setpoint3 | Setpoint4 | Setpoint5 | Setpoint6 | Setpoint7 | Setpoint8 | Setpoint9 | Setpoint10 | Setpoint11 | Setpoint12 | Setpoint13 | Setpoint14 | Setpoint15 |
