@section i2c cmsis I2C CMSIS
  Current I2C CMSIS driver version is 2.3

   - 2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug that the status ARM_I2C_EVENT_ADDRESS_NACK and ARM_I2C_EVENT_BUS_ERROR are not checked
        and returned in master interrupt callback.

   - 2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA-2012 violations.
        - Fixed rule 8.4, 8.6, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 11.1, 11.8, 11.9, 14.4, 16.1, 16.3, 16.4, 20.7, 20.9.

  - 2.1
    - Bug fixes
      - Fixed the issue that slave interrupt transfer could not do proper clock stretch.
        The slave must be configured with proper CLKDIV to provide sufficient data setup
        time for the master before releasing the stretched clock. Currently driver provides
        250ns clock set-up time.
      - Fixed Coverity issue of uninitialized scalar variable in I2C_InterruptGetStatus.

  - 2.0
    - Initial version.

@section usart cmsis USART CMSIS
  Current USART CMSIS driver version is 2.4

  - 2.4
    - Other Changes
      - Remove the ARM_USART_CONTROL_TX/ARM_USART_CONTROL_RX support, the USART
        driver doesn't support enable or disable TX/RX, the TX/RX are always
        enabled after set to ARM_POWER_FULL state.

  - 2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed bug that the status ARM_USART_EVENT_RX_OVERFLOW, ARM_USART_EVENT_TX_UNDERFLOW, ARM_USART_EVENT_RX_FRAMING_ERROR
        and ARM_USART_EVENT_RX_PARITY_ERROR are not checked and returned in interrupt callback.

  - 2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the violations of MISRA C-2012 rules: 8.4,8.6,10.1,10.3,10.4,11.1,11.9,14.4,15.7,16.1,16.3,16.6,17.7,20.9.

  - 2.1
    - New Features
      - Added support for more instances(USART10, USART11, USART12, USART13).

  - 2.0
    - Initial version.

@section cmsis spi  CMSIS SPI
  Current CMSIS SPI driver version is 2.6

   - 2.6
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fix ARM_SPI_GetDataCount bug when using DMA mode, and desired data size larger than 1024.
    - Improvements
      - Remove duplicated code in SPI_DMASend and SPI_DMAReceive.

   - 2.5
    - Bug Fixes
      - Remove DMA_Init from SPI_DMAPowerControl.

  - 2.4
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA-2012 violations.
        - Fixed rule 8.4, 8.6, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.8, 11.8, 11.9, 14.4, 16.1, 16.3, 16.4, 17.7,  20.9.

  - 2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that, the parameter num of APIs ARM_SPI_Transfer, ARM_SPI_Send and ARM_SPI_Receive,
        and the return value of API ARM_SPI_GetDataCount should be the number of data item defined
        by datawidth, rather than the number of byte.

  - 2.2
    - New Features
      - Added support for more instances(SPI10, SPI11, SPI12, SPI13).

  - 2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the wrong clock polarity assignment in driver. For ARM_SPI_CPOL0_CPHA0 and other
        frame format parameters, CPOL = 0 means kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveHigh rather than
        kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveLow in driver.
      - Fixed compiling error by deleting the definition and every usage of s_spiResetInstance in
        fsl_spi_cmsis.c, since peripheral reset is performed in FLEXCOMM_Init.
    - New Features
      - Added code to allow user to set up the default Transmit value by using
        ARM_SPI_SET_DEFAULT_TX_VALUE.

  - 2.0
    - Initial version.
