@section spi_cmsis SPI_CMSIS
  Current spi_cmsis driver version is 2.3

  - 2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA-2012 violations.
        - Fixed rule 8.4, 8.6, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 10.8, 11.8, 11.9, 14.4, 16.1, 16.3, 16.4, 17.7,  20.9.

  - 2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that, the parameter num of APIs ARM_SPI_Transfer, ARM_SPI_Send and ARM_SPI_Receive,
        and the return value of API ARM_SPI_GetDataCount should be the number of data item defined
        by datawidth, rather than the number of byte.

  - 2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the wrong clock polarity assignment in driver.
        For ARM_SPI_CPOL0_CPHA0 and other frame format parameters, CPOL = 0 means kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveHigh
        not kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveLow in driver.
    - New features
      - Added new feature to support 3-wire mode for both master and slave instance.
        User can use ARM_SPI_MODE_MASTER_SIMPLEX to set the MOSI pin as output/input pin,
        and use the ARM_SPI_MODE_SLAVE_SIMPLEX to set the MISO pin as output/input pin.
      - Allowed user to set up the default transmit value by using ARM_SPI_SET_DEFAULT_TX_VALUE.

  - 2.0
    - Initial version.
