@section dspi_cmsis DSPI_CMSIS
  Current dspi_cmsis driver version is 2.3

  - 2.3
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the MISRA-2012 violations.
        - Fixed rule 8.4, 8.6, 10.1, 10.3, 10.4, 11.1, 11.8, 14.4, 16.1, 16.3, 17.7, 17.3, 17.7, 20.9.

  - 2.2
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the bug that, the parameter num of APIs ARM_SPI_Transfer, ARM_SPI_Send and ARM_SPI_Receive,
        and the return value of API ARM_SPI_GetDataCount should be the number of data item defined
        by datawidth, rather than the number of byte.

  - 2.1
    - Bug Fixes
      - Fixed the wrong clock polarity assignment in driver.
        For ARM_SPI_CPOL0_CPHA0 and other frame format parameters, CPOL = 0 means kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveHigh
        not kSPI_ClockPolarityActiveLow in driver.

    - New Features
      - Allowed user to set up the default transmit value by using ARM_SPI_SET_DEFAULT_TX_VALUE.
      - Enabled slave select mode. Note this has no effect when user sets any of them because
        the driver can only support the hardware control function.

  - 2.0
    - Initial version.
